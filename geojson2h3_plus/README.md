`geojson2h3_plus` is a Dart/Flutter library for converting between GeoJSON polygons and H3 hexagon indexes, using either:

* [`h3_dart_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_dart_plus)
* [`h3_flutter_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/h3_flutter_plus)

### Status & Roadmap

This package is based on a handwritten implementation originally created by [festelo](https://github.com/festelo), which included only two methods without using any JavaScript dependencies. This version simply updates that work to be compatible with the H3 v4 bindingsâ€”no new functionality has been added yet.

Future updates aim to implement the full set of features from Uber's original [geojson2h3](https://github.com/uber/geojson2h3) JavaScript library, continuing the same Dart-first, dependency-free approach.

### Example

```dart
// h3_flutter_plus example
import 'package:h3_flutter_plus/h3_flutter_plus.dart';

final h3Factory = const H3Factory();
final h3 = h3Factory.load();
final geojson2h3 = Geojson2H3(h3);

final hexagon = BigInt.from(0x89283082837ffff);
final hexagonFeature = geojson2h3.h3ToFeature(hexagon);
```

### Currently Supported Methods

```dart
geojson2h3.h3ToFeature()
geojson2h3.h3SetToFeatureCollection()
```

More information on the original functionality can be found here:

### Notes

* This package is part of the H3 v4 Dart/Flutter bindings ecosystem maintained at [codewithsam110g/h3\_flutter\_bindings](https://github.com/codewithsam110g/h3_flutter_bindings).
* It is a drop-in replacement for users of the older, unmaintained `geojson2h3` Dart packages.
